----------------------------------------------------

The World Health Statistics series is the World Health
Organizationâ€™s (WHOâ€™s) annual compilation of health
statistics for its 194 Member States. The series is produced
by WHOâ€™s Division for Data, Analytics and Delivery, in
collaboration with WHO technical departments and regional
offices.

World health statistics 2019 summarizes recent trends and
levels in life expectancy and causes of death, and reports
on the health and health-related Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) and associated targets. Where possible, the
2019 report disaggregates data by WHO region, World
Bank income group, and sex; it also discusses differences in
health status and access to preventive and curative services,
particularly in relation to differences between men and
women. Where possible, it indicates the roles of sex as a
biological determinant, and of gender as a social construct,
in accounting for the observed differences (Table O1).
The analyses presented are not exhaustive; nevertheless, it
is hoped that the report will raise awareness of some critical
sex and gender differences in health outcomes, highlight
the importance of those differences in the attainment
of the SDGs, and encourage the roles of sex and gender
to be systematically taken into account when collecting
data, analysing health situations, formulating policies and
designing health programmes.

This overview summarizes the principal findings of the
World health statistics 2019. The full report can be accessed
